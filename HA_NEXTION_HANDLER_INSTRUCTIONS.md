# Home Assistant nextion_handler.py Instruction Set
(_Version 0.5; Last updated: 2022-05-25_)

Nextion Handler allows you to program a Nextion touch screen device (NSPanels in particular) to interact with Home Assistant (HA) **without having to do any coding in ESPHome YAML or Home Assistant automations**.  It uses a supporting Python script (to handle '**command_strings**' that you program into your HMI files) together with some boilerplate code (that does the routine parts of executing your programmed commands).

* :arrow_forward: **ESPhome** acts as a passive conduit tranferring command_strings from the Nextion to HA and Nextion Instructions back from HA to the Nextion (standarized boilerplate YAML configuration).

* :arrow_forward: **Home Assistant** configuration is a single automation to confgure the `nextion_handler.py` service (and includes a dictionary of entity_id aliases to help manage which Home Assitant entity you associate with each Nextion variable).

* :arrow_forward: All programming logic is kept together in one place, the **Nextion Editor** HMI files, supported by standardized boilerplate code to handle the HA interaction loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Nextion Handler Framework Overview
There are only 3 places where you need to add customized code to your Nextion Editor HMI file to link it to HA: 2 types of Nextion Handler commands (**NHCmds**), and 1 'subroutine'.

:arrow_forward: '**SET**' commands assign Nextion variables the values of data you request from Home Assistant.


SET commands are entered into text variables on each page as **command strings** (which are lists of NHCmds separated by commas or linebreaks, with arguements separated by spaces). The **boilerplate [Postinit]** event of each page sends the HA_Set command_strings to HA.


:arrow_forward: '**ACTION**' commands perform actions you request in HA (to control lights, scenes, scripts,  etc.).

Your Events in Nextion Editor need to assign a sequence of ACTION NHCmds to a command_string string. You then send the commands with the **boilerplate** '**SEND_ACTIONS**' subroutine, which temporarilly speeds up the **boilerplate** '**UPDATE_LOOP**' (a Nextion timer that enforces state changes to a **TRIGGER** value to signal how Home Assistant should respond).


:arrow_forward: '**APPLY_VARS**' is a Nextion 'subroutine' where you place your code for visualising changes in data and refreshing the UI.

## Getting Started: Template and Demo Files
If you would rather not do any programing at all, the pre-complied Widget UI NSPanel templates provide a very easy starting point for linking your NSPanels to Home Assistant (but with the trade-off that there is less room to customise the UI).

If you want full control of how your Nextion UI looks and interacts with HA, then you can use the instruction set below in your Nextion HMI files to do that (and you can mix your customised pages with the generic/adaptable Widget UI pages in the same project, which lets you gradually customise the parts of the UI that are most important to you).
The easiest way to get started is to use some of the example files (included in this repository) as templates, try out the debug page in the Nextion Editor, then play with customizing the UI components to create a test page that fits your own project to try out on your own device.

The documentation below should help in exploring the example HMI files and creating/adapting your own.

## Nextion Handler Instruction Set
‚ñ∂Ô∏è `Nx` = Nextion variable name
 
<details>
  <summary>as a shorthand ...</summary>

... for `Nx` you can _exclude_ the '.val'/'.txt' suffix if you have included the page prefix with the variable name;

--- 
  
</details>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è `E` = $alias or HA entity_id;

<details>
  <summary>as a shorthand ...</summary>

... for `E`: _a)_ in Set commands `$` alone can be used for `E` to indicate the alias should be the same as the associated `Nx` (shorthand) variable name; _b)_ in Action commands the entity class can be ommited where it is implicit, e.g. you can drop `script.` from `E` when calling the `scpt E` command).

--- 
  
</details>


### üî∫ SET COMMAND LIST
You enter SET commands in the Nextion Editor text variables `HA_SET1` .. `HA_SET5` on each page.  You use them to configure how you want to pull data from Home Assistant each time that the Nextion page is updated and what HA data you want assigned to each Nextion variable.

<details>
  <summary>more ...</summary>

üî∫ SET commands typically perform the following steps:
 
- Expand the shorthand Nextion variable (`Nx`) to the full variable name.
- Look up the entity $alias  (`E`) in the alias dictionary to retrieve the full HA entity_id.
- Get the required state and/or attributes of the HA entity and post-process these as required to return the value(s) in a form that is directly useable in the Nextion code.
- Assign the value to the Nextion variable by sending a Nextion Instruction to make the assignement (using the ESPHome `send_command_printf()` command configured in ESPHome to be available as a service to HA) - so the ultimate assignent is executed as an instruction on the Nextion device itself, while the `nextion_handler` determines exactly what instruction needs to be sent.

--- 
  
</details>

üî∫ `sett Nx len E`  (assign `len` chars of state of `E`, as string/text, to `Nx`).

üî∫ `setn Nx scale E (d)` (assign `Nx` the integer value of `scale` * state of `E`)

<details>
  <summary>  more ...</summary>

  The scaling factor (`scale`) can cater for the way `Nx` uses ints to represent floats (stored as int(val * num_dps) and for changing of units, e.g. for energy, 1dp kW fits better on small display than Watts, so HA state in Watts * scalefactor of 0.01 gives `Nx` 1 dp float in kW (divide by 1000 to convert Watts to kW, then multiply by 10 to store as Nextion 1dp float): `setn EN.sol 0.1 $ 0`.
 
  Optionally specify a value, `d`, to return if state of E is not numeric, otherwise the setn commands will be skipped on errors.

--- 
  
</details>


üî∫ `setb Nx E` (assign `Nx` 0 or 1 based whether the state of `E` is in FALSE_STATES)).

üî∫ `setb Nx E cp x` (assign `Nx` 0 or 1 based on comparing (`cp`) the state of `E` to `x`)
<details>
      <summary>more ...</summary>
    
   The comparitor, `cp`, must be  in   `[eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, =, !=, <, <=, >, >=]`.
 
   Optionally specify a value, `d`, to return if state of E is not numeric, otherwise the setb command will be skipped on errors.

--- 
  
</details>


üî∫ `setlt Nx_state Nx_tp Nx_brt Nx_ct Nx_rgb565 E` (assign `Nx` variables the state,
    'type', brightness, color temperature and color of light `E`).
    
<details>
      <summary>more ...</summary>

   'type' is a bit-encoded value of the supported modes of light `E`: bits are 1:brightness, 2:color_temp, 3:rgb.

    The light color is converted to Nextion 16-bit RGB565 format (to assign directly to color attributes of Nextion UI components).

    Use '_' in place of `Nx` variable names to skip assignments for those attributes.

--- 
  
</details>

üî∫ `setntf Nx_count (Nx_title) (Nx_msg) (n) (chars_title) (chars_msg)` (assign 3 `Nx` variables the Count, Title and Message of the `n`th Persistent Notification.)
<details>
      <summary>more ...</summary>

   Use '_' in place of `Nx` variable names, or omit them, to skip assignments for those attributes.
 
   Default numeric arguments (if unassigned) are 1, for message num, and 255 for string len.)


--- 
  
</details>


üî∫ `setdt Nx` (assign `Nx` current data-time as "dd/mm HHhMM").

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è EXAMPLE: `setn IR.nRN_DL 1 $` (using shorthand notation).</summary>

(Equivalent to long form of `setn IR.nRN_DL.val 1 sensor.rain_delay`.)
Set the Nextion variable `IR.nRN_DL.val` to the integer value of the state of the HA entity with the alias `IR.nRN_DL` after multiplying by a scaling factor of 1.
 
In this example, assuming `sensor.rain_delay` was the entity_id associated with the alias `IR.nRN_DL` and had a value of "3" at the time the command was called, the `setn` commands would perform the following steps:

- Expand the shorthand Nextion variable (`Nx`) from `IR.nRN_DL` to `IR.nRN_DL.val`.
- Look up the HA entity_id  by translating the shorthand alias (`E`) from `$` (short for `$IR.nRN_DL`, from prepending `$` to the shorthand `Nx` argument) to the alias dictionary key `IR.nRN_DL`, and then retrieving the value of the entity_id associated with that key, `sensor.rain_delay` (configured in the alias dictionary section of the `nextion_handler` automation YAML - see the _alias example_ below for more detail).
- Get the state of `sensor.rain_delay` (assumed to be "3" in this example) and return the integer value of multiplying this by a scaling factor of 1.
- Assign the final value (3) to `IR.nRN_DL.val` by sending the Nextion Instruction `IR.nRN_DL.val=3` to make the assignement (via the service that uses the ESPHome `send_command_printf()`).

### üîª ACTION COMMAND LIST
You assign ACTION commands to the `HA_ACT` string in your Nextion Editor 'events'.  You use them to configure the service calls that you want Home Assistant to execute when triggered by Nextion touch events, such as UI button clicks.


üîª `tgl E` (toggle `E`).

üîª `ton E` (turn on `E`).

üîª `tof E` (turn off `E`).

üîª `inps E string` (set value of input_select `E` to `string`).

üîª `inpb E b` (turn input_binary `E` `on` if `b`!=0 otherwise turn `off`).

üîª `inpn E x` (set value of input_number `E` to `x`).

üîª `lt_brt E x` (set brightness percent of light `E` to `x` (0..100)).

üîª `lt_brtv E x` (set brightness value of light `E` to `x` (0..255)).

üîª `lt_ct E x` (set colour temperature of light `E` to `x` mireds).

üîª `lt_rgb E r g b` (set colour of light `E` to RGB = `r`, `g`, `b`).

üîª `lt_hs E h s` (set colour of light `E` to Hue = `h`, Saturation = `s`).

üîª `lt_cw E dx dy r` (set color of light `E` to Color-Wheel location `dx`, `dy` from centre of wheel radius `r`).

<details>
  <summary>more (color wheel example) ...</summary>

Assumes a Home-Assistant-style color-wheel with red (hue 0) at 3 o'clock, increasing CLOCKWISE to 360.
 
(CLOCKWISE accounts for display y increasing downwards, which reverses angle of Cartesian ArcTan. So hue=90, with a greenish color, is at the 6 o'clock position.)

The Nexion Editor example below shows a template generic 'pop-up' light control page (that can be called for an abritrary light entity) together with the event for tapping on the color wheel to build the `HA_ACT.txt` command_string to call the `lt_cw` NH command.
 
![Color wheel example in HMI](/current_version/images/LT_colorwheel_event.png)

--- 
  
</details>


üîª `lt_wt E` (set light `E` to a supported white/color_temp mode).

üîª `scn E` (turn on scene `E`).

üîª `scpt E` (call script `E`).

üîª `say E string` (Play TTS of message `string` to media player `E`).

üîª `ntf title|message` (Create a Persistent Notification in HA with strings `title` & `message` (separated by '|')).

üîª `ntfx n` (Dismiss the `n`th Persistent Notification in HA).

üîª `sub Nx` ('click' the Nextion (hidden) hotspot `Nx` to execute a 'subroutine': sends `click Nx,1` instruction to Nextion).

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è EXAMPLE: `scpt $rain+7` (using shorthand notation).</summary>

(Equivalent to long form of `scpt script.rain_delay_incr`.)
Calls a script to increase the 'rain delay' for suspending automated irrigation by 7 days.

## CUSTOMIZABLE components (with shorthand notation)

Click to expand sections below for an example of **how each of the 3 customized components were added to a Nextion page** to integrate it with HA.

![Example dark Minimalist style](/UI_Design/Minimalist/ExampleM_IR_ST_LT_1280x640.png)

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example NEXTION EVENT to SEND ACTION commands to Home Assistant (Nextion Editor - event tab, HA_ACT)</summary>
  
---

>You assign ACTION NHCmds to  `HA_Act.txt` in Nextion events, then send the commands with  `SEND_ACTIONS` (see **boilerplate SEND_ACTIONS** 'subroutine' code & details below).

This example shows how to program calling Home Assistant actions from within Nextion Editor Events.  The code is for the orange [+7] button at the bottom of a page for controlling irrigation automations.  The [Touch Release Event] has been programmed so that when this button is given a short press, a script will be called in Home Assistant to add 7 days to the 'rain delay' until automatic scheduling resumes.  Long-pressing the button is programmed instead to call a script that reduces this delay by 7 days.  (See **boilerplate GESTURE**s code & details below if you want to use `gest_type` swipe & press UI gestures.)
 
**TIP:** Change the font in the Nextion Editor to [a proper programming mono-spaced font](https://hadrysmateusz.medium.com/best-free-programming-fonts-2020-f243a6b4749a) (as below) - it makes reading and editing your code _much_ easier.

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example HA_SET string for pulling required HA data into Nextion pages (Nextion Editor - string, HA_SET1)</summary>
  
---

>You assign SET NHCmds directly to `HA_SET1.txt` (and up to 4 more) local text variables on each page.  The Page [Post Initialization Event] will then send the strings to HA to store for use in future page updates. (See **boilerplate Page PostInit** code & details below).

This example shows the `HA_SET1.txt` string to bring in the data required for a page that controls irrigation automations.  It fetches 6 numeric values (`setn`: for irrigation duration sliders and the rain delay), 5 binary values (`setb`: for the 5 toggle switches), and one text value (`sett`: for the `input_select` in HA that indicates the current status of the irrigation system.)  For all SET commands the enitity_id is specified with `$` which means they use a dictionary to look up the HA entity_id based on the Nextion variable name. (See the _aliases & automation example_ below, matching this `HA_SET1` string.)

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example APPLY_VARS to update Nextion UI with returned data from HA (Nextion Editor - APPLY_VARS 'subroutine')</summary>

---

>You put your Nextion code for modifying any UI components that use HA data in a 'subrountine' (a hidden `Hotspot`).  You will likely have this code already in your HMI file, you just have to place the UI refresh code in a subroutine.  Doing this allows HA to apply the UI changes immediately after sending updated data by sending the Nextion Instruction "`click APPLY_VARS,1`".

This example shows part of the `APPLY_VARS` subroutine for applying updates to the display of 'rain delay' information on a Nextion page for controlling irrigation automations.  The code updates the numeric value displayed then also: _a)_ changes a `Crop` image to show the cloud icon and label in a highlighted color if the rain delay is greater than 0; _b)_ changes the background image for the displayed number to match (so the number seems transparent as the background changes); and _c)_ changes the font color for displaying the number.  (The complete subroutine applies updates to all the other UI components too.  This code is typical of any HMI project - the only additional step is putting it in a subroutine.)
 
**Note on global scope, variables, persistence, and memory use:**  For changes in data to persist after switching pages in the Nextion, the data scope has to be made `global`.  For simple small projects it may be easier to make the whole button (or other UI component) `global` to be able to write updates directly to the UI component attributes (which could avoid the need for `APPLY_VARS` in a basic UI, but at the expense of being [very wasteful of the extremely restricted (3584 bytes) global SRAM memory on your Nextion](https://unofficialnextion.com/t/updating-fields-before-page-is-displayed/791/5)).  It is _much_ more efficient to write data updates to Nextion `variables` (which only use the `global` SRAM memory to store their value, without the overhead of storing multiple other UI component attributes too).  This however requires an `APPLY_VARS` step to apply the upated data in the `variables` to the appropriate UI attributes for the changes to become visible on the display.

## BOILERPLATE components

Click to expand sections below for boilerplate code (this is standardized code that you can copy and paste, without editing. It performs the routine tasks required to execute the NH commands you program in your CUSTOMIZED components.)

The details below help explain what the code is doing and how the pieces fit together.  But the easiest way to include the boilerplate components into your own projects is to use a page from one of the example HMI files as a template (and copy the set of components from there rather than trying to recreate them from the code below).

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è UPDATE_LOOP (Nextion Editor - timer)</summary>
  
---
> The `UPDATE_LOOP` is attached to a timer on each Nextion page to control the timing and scheduling of most important tasks (polling, updates, queues, dimming, sleeping: as detailed in the comments at the top of the standardized boilerplat code below) including fetching your data from Home Assistant in an orderly and efficient way.

You can modify the behaviour of the `UPDATE_LOOP` through Nextion Global Settings variables (see the **boilerplate `Program.s`** details below), without having to edit the code.  The example HMI files in this repository include a Nextion page that can adjust most of these settings from on the device (and you can use this as a template to adapt to your own HMI and UI style.)

  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è ESPHome configuration to send commands & data between HA and Nextion (ESPHome YAML file)</summary>
  
---
  
  > ESPHome has to be configured to transfer `TRIGGER`, `HA_ACT.txt`, and `HA_SET1.txt` .. `HA_SET5.txt` to Home Assistant.  It also needs to provide the `esphome.nsp1_send_command` service for HA to be able to send Nextion Instructions back to the Nextion device.

A template ESPHome YAML configuration is provided in the repository (where you just have to fill in the variables in the `substitutions:` section at the top of the file, shown in the YAML extract below).  The main components that you need to add to your ESPHome YAML configuration are shown below (and are marked with `***nextion_handler requirement***` throughout the full version of the template).

  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Nextion Handler (Home Assistant - Python script)</summary>

  > The **Nextion Handler** provides Home Assistant with the service that responds to TRIGGER state changes sent from the Nextion device and responds by executing the NhCmds that you program into your HMI code.  (You can download the Python script from this repository.)

To enable Python scripts in your Home Assistant add the line: `python_script:` to your `configuration.yaml` file. Then create the folder `<config>/python_scripts/` and and place the Python scripts you want to run there.  (You may need to restart for them to become available.) (See [Home Assistant Python Script documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/python_script/).)

The `automation.yaml` required to configure the `nextion_handler.py` script is shown next.

  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Nextion Handler service configuration and alias 'dictionary' (Home Assistant - automation.yaml)</summary>
  
---
  
>Below is a **Home Assistant automation** template to configure the `nextion_handler.py` service, including an example of an **alias 'dictionary'** (for managing how Nextion variables used in NH commands are associated with HA entity_ids).  You need a separate `automation:` for each Nextion device (but they all use the same Python script.)

The example dictionary matches the irrigation page used in the CUSTOMIZABLE examples above.

Aliases are convenient because _a)_ they save you having to switch back & forth between the Nextion Editor & HA, _b)_ the alias is typically based on the name of the Nextion (global) variable it is associated with, _c)_ they save you having to reflash the Nextion TFT each time you fix a typo in an entity_id, _d)_ you enter the entity_ids in the HA YAML editor (where autocompletion helps avoid typos in the first place), and _e)_ they make the command_strings shorter for more efficient management with the resource contraints of Nextion devices.

  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è (OPTIONAL) 'Swipe' and 'Press' GESTUREs (Nextion Editor - timer)</summary>
  
---

> Gestures are not a _requirement_ for Nextion Handler.  But they are helpful for many projects and the one included in the HMI templates is a very robust and generalizable implementation.  It uses a `GESTURES` timer (called by `tc0`) to interpret 'swipe' gestures in real time (to be able to respond to before a release Event is generated), and returns the final gesture as a `gest_type` code (a Global* variable) for 'Touch Release Events' of other UI components to use in their code.
 
The HMI example files have complete implementations with all code, and a Debug template to test out how they work (including components to demonstrate common traps in designing these gestures into your own HMI files.)
 
The swipe gestures work even on a page that is entirely covered in active 'dual state' buttons (triggering those components only on 'press' gestures, not 'swipes'), and the gestures are automatically disabled when a stroke starts on a 'slider' (to avoid UI conflicts).

More details on Nextion gesture approaches are being prepared in a separate document.
