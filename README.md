# Home Assistant Nextion Handler
(_Version 0.5; Last updated: 2022-05-28_)

**üöß documenting feature update in progress üöß**

'Nextion Handler' allows you to use a Nextion touch screen device (NSPanels in particular) to interact with Home Assistant (HA).  It uses a supporting Python script in Home Assitant to interpret and respond to instructions programmed into the Nextion device.  You can either use the full framework to create your own fully customised UIs in the Nextion Editor, or you can use specially pre-compiled files that don't require any programing and just some very basic configuration (or you can mix the two).


## Widget UI
There is now an ultra easy way to connect your NSPanel device to Home Assistant that doesn't require any programming or complex configuring.  The new Widget UI blends elements of the original NSPanel widgets, the Home Assistant 'glance' cards, and some of the graphical and functional aspects of Mushroom cards and Minimilist UI (popular UI mods for HA).  After installation, customising your Widgets is as simple as setting up an HA glance card - you simply provide a list of entities (and optionally a name and icon to go with them).  The Widget UI uses a group of pages tiled with a set of adaptable generic cards that are populated sequentially with information from your list of HA entities.  The information displayed adapts to the type of entity being displayed so that it shows useful information from a range of attributes specific to that type of entity, not just its 'state'.

The details of how information is displayed is still being fine tuned, and functionality is still being added for the types of things you can control in HA.  At this stage you can use the Widgets to:
* üî∏ easily view information about your smart home;
* üî∏ 'toggle' Home Assistant entities (lights, switches, scripts, automations, scenes etc.);
* üî∏ fully control lights (with a 'pop-up card');
* üî∏ read and dismiss HA notifications;
* üî∏ change NSPanel settings.
  
More features are continually being added (as the supported capabilities of the underlying Nextion Hanlder are being developed and expanded).

The Widget UI uses:
* üîπ an ESPHome template (flashed to Nextion's  ESP32 chip);
* üîπ an HA Python script (placed in your `/python_scripts` folder and configured with a YAML automation template);
* üîπ a precompiled 'TFT' UI file (that you upload to the Nextion UI chip).

Further details for the Widget UI, including installation instructions, [are being added here](/widget_ui).

## Full Nextion Handler instruction set
If you want full control of how your Nextion UI looks and interacts with HA, then you can use the full Nextion Handler framework (that the Widget UI uses) and include its instructions in your own  Nextion HMI files.  Full details of the this framework, and the instruction set it makes available to program HA interactions into your HMI files, are documented [here](/main/HA_NEXTION_HANDLER_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Nextion Touch UI Tips, Tricks & Traps
Some tips related to **[programing the touch interaction functionality](/Tips_and_Tricks)** of UIs may be useful to others programing Nextion devices (more generally tha this project or integration to HA).  This includes HMI code and examples for robust gestures, circular sliders, and geometric functions.

## Graphical UI design for HMIs
Some tips and information for **[designing graphical components of UIs](/UI_Design)** for small displays like the NSPanel may also be more widely useful for anyone programming HMI interfaces.  This includes template vector graphics files (that can easily be adapted to other projects) and example HMI files using these designs.  It has very detailed design rules and SVG templates for an adaption of the popular Minimilist UI style (as used in the screenshot above).
