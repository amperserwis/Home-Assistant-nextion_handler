# Material Design - Neon version

(_Last updated: 2022-05-13_)

This was the second Material Design approach I used.  It tried two main changes to the intial Material Design approach:

* The initial version could look a bit too 'flat' and dull on a Nextion screen.  To add more of a visual sense of distinction among elements this design added a neon glow to the edges to UI components.  For the icons this was achieved by using bright edges (stroke) around dark centres (fill), together with subtle horizontal gradients for the stroke and fill (subtle enough not to cause banding once displayed as 16-bit color on the Nextion displays).
* Rather than trying to compensate for the strong blue cast of the screen (by shifting hues to yellow), it used this a feature to exagerate the glowing edges effect.

**Example color theme using the 'glowing edges' design:**  The strong blue cast on the Nextion displays and the exagerated contrast (when viewing the NSPanel at an angle from above) makes the neon glow effect more prononounced on the actual device (and clearer than the disabled icons below show when the viewed on a normal display).
