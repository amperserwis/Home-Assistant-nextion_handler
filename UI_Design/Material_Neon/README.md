# Material Design - Neon version

This was the second Material Design approach I used.  It tried two main changes to the intial Material Design approach:

* The initial version could look a bit to 'flat' and dull on a Nextion screen.  To add more of a visual sense of distinction among elements it used glowing edges for some UI components (mainly icons), achieved by using bright edges (stroke) around dark centres (fill) together with subtle gradients for the stroke and fill.
* Rather than trying to compensate for the strong blue cast of the screen (by shifting hues to yellow), it worked with elevated blue tones as part of the glowing edges effect.
