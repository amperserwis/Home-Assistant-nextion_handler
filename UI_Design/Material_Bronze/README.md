# Material Design - Bronze theme

This was the first UI for my own NSPanels.  It was easy to recolorise to try out what color themes worked best and to tweak colors to for clear distinctions on the Nextion screen to deal with two main constraints of the display:

* a strong blue cast that markedly changes the appearance of colors realtive to what they look like when creating them (on a PC monitor) - shifting hues towards yellow can help a bit (although the colors will look a bit off while viewing on a normal screen).
* files are converted to a compressed 16-bit format for storage on the Nextion which can futher distort colors and create other artefacts such as banding of smooth gradients (you can dither the input graphics files to offset this problem visually, but at the expense of larger stored files). 'Flat' design systems, such the Material Design framework, help mitigate these problems.
