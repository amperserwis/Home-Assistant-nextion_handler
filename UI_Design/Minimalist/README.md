# Minimalist Design
(_Last updated: 2022-05-17_)

**_work in progress_**

This is the current UI design that I'm using on my NSPanels.  It is also the one that is easiest for others to use as template because it has been set up with:
* ðŸ”¹ Well structured and named object hiearchy (dock the 'Objects' tool to the first side bar and use it as the main method for selecting groups/items to edit.  This is especially important for where in the hiearchy you copy from (the whole group from that level down will be copied) and where in the hiearchy you paste to (it will be inserted above the selected item)).
* ðŸ”¹ A selection of common UI component templates, all built on a base of 40x40 px block multiples to easily snap to a 40x40 grid (to cleanly fit together a 320x480 NSPanel display).
* ðŸ”¹ A palette of named swatch colors (to easily change and tweak color themes across the project).
* ðŸ”¹ A well-defined set of rules is documented below, making it easy to use and modify UI 'cards' that have a coherent style and can convey dense information in an efficient and consistent manner.


**Screenshot in Inkscape showing elements organised with named hierarchical grouping**.  Flexible turning on/off visibility of individual graphical elements within components allows them to be easily adapted for multiple UI functions.

## Anatomy of a UI Card
A precise set of parametric rules define how UI components are constructed (although these are applied with the pragmatic Pythonic maxim,   _"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds..." (Emerson)_.)  The rules are described sequentially for each element below, from the base layer upwards, noting that each individual UI card would ultimately only use a subset of these elements (and would hide the rest).  
ðŸŽ‰ The advantage of this approach is that anyone with a little planning and patience can create stunningly beautiful UIs that are highly customised to their specific needs (without requiring much creative ability).

### ðŸ”¸ EXTENT (structural foundation):
_The base foundation is a transparent rectangle that is a multiple of 20 x 20 px blocks (snapped to 20x20 grid)._  
It sets the outer bounds of the component, ensures that all components will snap together cleanly, and maintains the reference for offsets by which each constituent element floats away from grid edges.  For a typical single entity card, with label, (like the `Garage` light example above) this would be 80px x 120px.

### ðŸ”¸ shadow (beneath card):
_Offsets from the EXTENT: top = 3px, sides = 4px, bottom = 3px. Rectangle rounding radius (of corners) = 11px._  
No blurring is applied. (Sharp shadows look cleaner on a low-resolution display.  If blurring is applied, then a 'clip mask' will be needed to keep the blurring with the bounds of EXTENT, otherwise snapping and page boundaries will be compromised).

### ðŸ”¸ card (visible base):
_Offsets from the EXTENT: top = 3px, sides = 5px, bottom = 5px. Rectangle rounding radius = 10px._  
The card is the visible base on which all other elements are laid.  The card casts a `shadow` onto the background `wallpaper`.

### ðŸ”¸ circle (icon background, full size):
_Circle radius = 30px. Offsets from the EXTENT: top = 10px, sides = 10px. (Centre snapped to 20x20 grid.)_  
`Circle`s are used as the background to `icon`s and convey the state and function of the entity associated with each `icon` more clearly.

### ðŸ”¸ icon (full size):
_Mater Design Icon SVGs with 250% scaling fits in 30px radius background `circle`._  
Color conventions for `icon`s and background `circle`s are detailed futher down.

### ðŸ”¸ labels:
_16pt Robotto Condensed. 15px below bottom of circle, centred. (Offset from EXTENT: bottom = 35px.)_  
(Secondary labels, such as units of measure: _14 pt Robotto Condensed_.)

### ðŸ”¸ bar (horizontal sliders and background for dynamic text)
_Rectangle height 28px, rounding radius 7px. Offsets from the EXTENT: top = 10px, sides = 10px. Circle radius = 30px. (Centre snaps to 20x20 grid.)_  
... wide horizontal (full / half width)  (sizes of card, circ & icon for interactive & static icons)

### ðŸ”¸ button (modified bar)
_Variant of `bar` with rounding radius = 14px (so that rounding diameter = height = 28px to form semi-circluar end caps)._  
The card behind a single row of buttons also has semi-circular end caps, with diameter = height, such that _`card` rectangle radius = 16px, `shadow` rectangle radius = 17px and `EXTENT` height = 40px_.  
Circ & icon sizes....

### ðŸ”¸ scenes (multiselector)
_Variant of standard icons with enlarged circle background that merges with a small bar below as background for a text label._  
Multiple mutually-exclusive scenes are placed next to each other - the selected scene is highlighted (using the active color coding for interactive icons described below) while all other related scene options are colored in their inactive state.

### ðŸ”¸ wallpaper (page background)
_Master wallpaper covering full display (320px x 480px) CLONED for each page._  
Using 'clones' of a 'master' `wallpaper` makes it much easier to manage the background on each page.  This way, any edits made to the master will automatically flow through to every page (and makes it much more convenient if you want to test textured backgrounds, in place of a solid color, in a later theme).  
(For the EU NSPanel, the right hand side of the display is hidden, which has to taken into account when creating images (that still need to be 480x320, but with the covered part of the display blacked out).  The SVG file includes a template for this which involves working on 500x320 area, so that cards can still be snapped to grid an maintain their alignment - marked areas on each edge show what needs to be clipped to recentre the grid-aligned cards and the rectangle that can be used as the final 'clip mask' for the page, to extract the recentred 480x320 image, is included in the template.)


## Color Conventions
Consistently following a set of conventions for how UI elements are colored makes it much easier to interpret dense information on the display at a glance.

### States and Interaction
* ðŸ”¹ A `colored icon` indicates that it is `interactive` (it will trigger an action when touched), whereas grey-scale icons provide information that is not directly interactive (such as sensor information).
* ðŸ”¹ A `colored background` indicates that information for that entity is in an `active` state (it is 'on', the value exceeds a threshold, or it matches some criteria, such as tracker location matching "Home"), whereas a grey-scale background indicates that is in its non-active state.

### Icon and Background Colors (part of named 'swatch' palette)
* ðŸ”¹ Five colors are used to indicates states and interactive elements: orange, red, purple, blue, green (following [Lovelace Minimalist UI](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/) and [Mushroom Cards](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590)).
* ðŸ”¹ Three variants are used for each color (ranked from brightest to darkest): Active_Icon (used when an interactive icon is in its active state, and blended into the grey background with transparency when in its inactive state); Active_Background (applied to an icon background when in its active state; also applied to the interactive state of other elements such as slider bars); and Dim (used for the slider background, the background of dynamic text).

### Example icon types coloring:
* ðŸ”¹ For an interactive icon (e.g. `Garage` light above): Active state (Active_Icon icon color on Active_Background background); Inactive state(Active_Icon semi-transparent icon on inactive grey background)
* ðŸ”¹ For an non-interactive icon (e.g. `Front` door contact sensor above): Active state (inactive grery icon color on Active_Background background); Inactive state(inactive grey semi-transparent icon on inactive grey background).
* ðŸ”¹ For static information icon (e.g. the temperature icon for above the `light color temperature` slider above): Enabled state (white icon on inactive grey background); Disabled state (dark disabled grey icon on inactive grey background).

### Structural backgrounds
Greyscale

### Labels
.... bright & dim

### Buttons
... White on button-colored (between Active and background blue).

## Creating Customised/Variant Cards
Although the included SVG file has many cards and components that you can use in your projects, you will likely want to create some of your own custom cards as the base components that you duplicate for your own projects.  In these cases it will often be easiest to start from basic similar card (like and 80x120 entity card or a slider card) and customise it to your needs. 

### Resizing
... don't just resize whole object - resize each element invidually maintaining offsets above. (Extent, then shadow, then card: Adjust Rect height and width in multiples of 40px - offset from original will be maintained and keep everything correct).

### Grouped Cards
For a grouped card, that combines multiple entities, it is **easier to expand an indvidual card** (than to try merging multiple individual cards).  Start with a basic card for an individual entity that you want to group and expand it (by **resizing the rectangles for the EXTENT, shadow and card** elements, as described above).  **Then duplicate the elements you want multiples of** in the group (circles, icons, bars, buttons) and rearrange those duplicated elements (aligned to where they would of been if they had remained part of separate, adjacent, ungrouped cards).  The `Bedroom` card above shows an example thats groups four entities together on one card.


### Editing Tips
Side bar setup with docked tools...
Use 'Objects' hieararchy (rather than ungrouping then regrouping) to select, copy/duplicate and paste...
Parametric editing.... (transform to move, rectangle to resize)
Mouse quick selection: Select (objects) vs Node (elements) (and Rectangle, Text etc. when editing objects of those types).
