# Minimalist Design
(_Last updated: 2022-05-13_)

**_work in progress_**

This is the current UI design that I'm using on my NSPanels.  It is also the one that is easiest for others to use as template because it has been set up with:
* Well structured and named object hiearchy (dock the 'Objects' tool to the first side bar and use it as the main method for selecting groups/items to edit).
* A selection of common UI component templates, all built on a base of 40x40 px block multiples to easily snap to a 40x40 grid (to cleanly fit together a 320x480 NSPanel display).
* A palette of named swatch colors (to easily change and tweak color themes across the project).
