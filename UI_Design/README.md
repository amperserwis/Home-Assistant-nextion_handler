# User Interface Design for Nextion devices

_**... work in progress ...**_

These resources may be helpful for others designing the graphics for their interfaces on small HMI (human-machine interface) screens like Nextions.

The SVG files have full multi-page project examples (a lot more than the thumbnails), have template components that be easily adapted, and use 'swatches' for easily changing the color scheme off all components.

The UI designs rely on [a robust implementation of 'gestures'](https://github.com/krizkontrolz/Home-Assistant-nextion_handler/tree/main/Tips_and_Tricks), so that touch-interactive components can cover the entire screen.

## Design Themes
1) Material Design - Dark Bronze theme (to match bronzed buttons and case - used in first HMI).
2) Material Design - Dark Neon theme (to use, instead of work against, the strong blue cast of Nextion screens - used in second HMI).
3) Minimilist Design - adapted from Yuhang Lu's concept and related adaptations to Home Assistant - see credits below (used in current HMI).
