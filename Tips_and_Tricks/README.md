## Tips, Tricks, and Traps for Nextion Devices

This folder has a Nextion Editor HMI file for demonstrating several ways to expand the possibilities for designing Nextion user interfaces (beyond the features that are directly supported in your device class).

A series of documents explain the various tips, tricks, and traps illustrated on the pages of the HMI file.

1) [Gestures](/Tips_and_Tricks/NEXTION_GESTURES.md)
2) [Dynamic Round Sliders](/Tips_and_Tricks/ROUND_SLIDERS.md)
3) [Geometric functions](/Tips_and_Tricks/GEOMETRIC_FUNCTIONS.md)
 

You can discuss this and make suggestions for improvements on the [Unoffical Nextion formum post](https://unofficialnextion.com/t/nextion-gesture-tips-tricks/1585).
